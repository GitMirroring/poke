maintainers and developers of the GNU poke project.

                           GNU maintainers
                           ---------------

Jose E. Marchesi       <jemarch@gnu.org>
Mohammad-Reza Nabipoor <mnabipoor@gnu.org>

                        Subsystem Maintainers
                        ---------------------

Maintainers are individuals who are responsible for, and have
permission to check in changes in, certain subsets of the code, and
push them to the master branch.  They can also approve patches in
these areas, sent by other people.  Note that that maintainers still
need approval to check in changes outside of the immediate domain that
they maintain.

Note also that maintainers are still asked to send [COMMITTED]
messages to the list with the patches they push.  This helps to keep
the other hackers aware of what is going on in other areas.
