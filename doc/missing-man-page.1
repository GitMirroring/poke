.SH NAME
Jitter \- an efficient Virtual Machine generator

.SH DESCRIPTION
Alas, there is not much information here.

.SH THIS MAN PAGE IS A STUB
The system on which the Jitter source tarball was built
lacked the GNU help2man utility or used cross-compilation
without an emulator available to run the produced file with
\fB\-\-help\fR ;
for these reasons this page is just a placeholder.

Anyway, the actual documentation is in Texinfo.  If your Info system
is well configured and you have installed Jitter then you should be
able to use the command line

\fBinfo\ jitter\fR

to access the full documentation; and of course the best way to use the Info
documentation is from GNU Emacs.

The official manual can also be compiled into Info, PostScript, PDF or HTML
from the source distribution via

\fBmake\ info\ ps\ pdf\ html\fR

JitterLisp, an elaborate example of Jitter use, also has its own manual written
in Texinfo, which is built from the same command line above.  You may access it
with

\fBinfo\ jitterlisp\fR

or equivalently from Emacs.
